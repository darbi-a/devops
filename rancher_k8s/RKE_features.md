1. Create, upgrade, and manage Kubernetes clusters
Rancher can create clusters by itself or work with a hosted Kubernetes provider.
- Rancher Launched Kubernetes: clusters created and managed by Rancher itself by either:
+ Using nodes from an infrastructure provider
+ Bringing your own nodes with Docker installed (custom nodes)
- Hosted Kubernetes Providers: Using a hosted Kubernetes service like GKE, AKS, or EKS
2. Import any existing Kubernetes clusters
3. Use an authentication provider configured in Rancher to set up access to any Kubernetes cluster
4. User Interface to your Kubernetes clusters for easy management and adoption
5. API to automate any steps you want to perform
6. Integrated alerting and logging that can be deployed in any cluster
7. Integrated pipelines to easily deploy from code repository to cluster
